      <description>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();My Friend recommended this Super Awesome game The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim.zip and obviously it was downloaded from a random website from the internet ( some ripoff of the OceanOfGames.com ). The contents of the The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim.zip are as follows : -
 The setup file was very much suspicious because
 the size was only 506KB Windows Defender was preventing it from extracting in the VM. the icon was also acting weird when view of the file explorer was changed (i don&amp;rsquo;t really know whats up with that) but a well made setup for game wont go crazy like this.</description>

      <description>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();Challenge: License [ 298(DYN) RE ] Challenge Description:
Written by: ItzSomebodyDescription: Keith made a cool license-checking program but he forgot the flag he used to create the key! To make matters worse, he lost the source code and stripped the binary for his license-generator program. Can you help Keith recover his flag? All he knows is:• The license key is 4-EZF2M-7O5F4-V9P7O-EVFDP-E4VDO-O• He put his name (in the form of &amp;#39;k3ith&amp;#39;) as the first part of the flag• There are 3 underscores• The flag is in the format hsctf{}• The flag doesn&amp;#39;t have random character sequences (you should be able to read the entire flag easily).</description>

      <description>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();The Vulnerability The PKZIP program is one of the more widely used archive/compression programs on personal computers. PKZIP provides a stream cipher which allows users to scramble files with variable length keys ( passwords ). We can find the internal representation of the key within a few hours on a PC using a few bytes of known plaintext. This Stream cipher was designed by Roger Schlafly.
We will take a look at the Forensics 3 challenge from RiftCTF2020, But first lets understand the weakness.</description>

      <description>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();  Recently I was watching GynvaelEN&amp;rsquo;s Old Stream about ELF Packers, and I thought why not make a PE Packer. I decided that I will write a python script to Parse PE Headers from scratch, I was able to parse some headers and then I got stuck and decided that I will use PEFILE.
