<p>My Friend recommended this Super Awesome game <strong>The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim.zip</strong> and obviously it was downloaded from a random website from the internet ( some ripoff of the OceanOfGames.com ).
the contents of the <strong>The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim.zip</strong> are as follows



<div class="center">
  <img
    src="/img/reversing-a-malware/files.PNG"
    alt="files in the zip file"
    decoding="async"
  />
</div></p>
<p>the setup file was very much suspicious because</p>
<ol>
<li>the size was only 506KB</li>
<li>Windows Defender was preventing it from extracting in the VM.</li>
<li>the icon was also acting weird when view of the file explorer was changed (i dont really know whats up with that) but a well made setup for game wont go crazy like this.</li>
</ol>
<p>then i opened the exe in Resource Hacker and looked at the string table



<div class="center">
  <img
    src="/img/reversing-a-malware/res-hack.PNG"
    alt="string table for the setup file"
    decoding="async"
  />
</div></p>
<p>i noticed this</p>
<pre><code>STRINGTABLE
LANGUAGE LANG_FRENCH, SUBLANG_FRENCH
{
  103, 	&quot;mywscript2&quot; &lt;----- compiled with script2exe lol
  109, 	&quot;MYWSCRIPT2&quot; &lt;-----
}
</code></pre><p>i am guessing this is what they used to compile a bat file or a vbs file to this exe
<a href="https://github.com/Pingze-github/script2exe">Pingze-github/script2exe</a></p>
<p>hmmmmmmm</p>
<p>lets load this file into IDA Pro
immediately after loading it into IDA Pro, IDA tells us that a PDB file was linked to this file



<div class="center">
  <img
    src="/img/reversing-a-malware/pdb.PNG"
    alt="Debug Info"
    decoding="async"
  />
</div></p>
<p>this is another proof that it&rsquo;s not a legit binary at all .
what comes next proves this. I tried to execute this exe and all it did was just renamed the .bin file which was present in the same folder as the exe to Game.iso and then a message box appeared telling me to open the .iso file in PowerISO and run the setup inside it.</p>
<p>now we need to look at the script which it executes.
The original script is retained in the EXE stub&rsquo;s resources section as a Bitmap resource numbered &ldquo;129&rdquo; after it is encrypted with RC4. so we can use any debugger to dump the script after its decrypted, i initially planned to do that but then something else caught my eyes.</p>
<p>there was a new entry in the &lsquo;Startup&rsquo; tab of task manager named &lsquo;Windows Update Service.vbe&rsquo;
why not a service without an icon and a &lsquo;.vbe&rsquo; at the end. this means that the script will run everytime your PC is started. so i copied the vbe file into my linux VM to analyse. I used this <a href="https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/decode-vbe.py">script</a> to decode the vbe file, Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DidierStevens/">DidierStevens</a></p>



<div class="center">
  <img
    src="/img/reversing-a-malware/dump.PNG"
    alt="the decoded vbe file"
    decoding="async"
  />
</div>
<p>first it tries to ping <a href="http://www.google.com.244883378346760.window-updates-service.com">www.google.com.244883378346760.window-updates-service.com</a>
and checks if the host is up or not</p>
<p>and then it tries to run chrome or firefox with remote-debugging, you would also notice a sudden peek in CPU Usage.</p>
<p>the reason for that is that this is a Crypto Currency Miner. it uses your browser&rsquo;s Javascript sandbox to run a wasm binary which basically runs super fast and does the mining stuff.</p>
